# Kotlin Algorithms & Data Structures

Welcome to the **Kotlin Algorithms & Data Structures** repository! This open-source project is dedicated to implementing a wide range of algorithms and data structures using Kotlin, a modern programming language that offers clarity, conciseness, and powerful features.

## Our Mission
Our aim is to provide a comprehensive collection of well-implemented algorithms and data structures in Kotlin, making it an invaluable resource for developers, students, and educators alike. Whether you're preparing for technical interviews, teaching computer science concepts, or just looking to explore algorithms in a new language, this repository has something for you.

## What You'll Find Here
- **Algorithms:** From basic sorting and searching to more advanced graph and dynamic programming algorithms, our collection is continually growing.
- **Data Structures:** Implementations of essential data structures like lists, trees, graphs, stacks, queues, and more, showcasing Kotlin's capabilities.
- **Examples and Tests:** Each implementation is accompanied by examples and thorough tests to ensure reliability and ease of understanding.
- **Documentation:** Clear documentation for each algorithm and data structure, explaining the logic, complexity, and potential use cases.
