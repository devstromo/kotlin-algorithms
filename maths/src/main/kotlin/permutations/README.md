# Permutations

Permutations refer to the various ways in which a set of elements can be arranged. The concept of permutations is
fundamental in combinatorial mathematics and has applications in many fields, including computer science, statistics,
and cryptography.

## Properties of Permutations

1. **Factorial Growth**: The number of permutations of a set of `n` elements is `n!` (n factorial). This means the
   number of permutations grows very quickly as `n` increases.
2. **Uniqueness**: Each permutation is a unique arrangement of the elements in the set. No two permutations are the
   same.
3. **Symmetry**: For a set of `n` elements, each element appears in the same position in exactly `(n-1)!` permutations.

## Generating Permutations

### String Permutations

To generate all permutations of a string, we use a recursive approach. The algorithm involves swapping characters to
create new permutations and using a helper function to manage the recursive calls.

### Number Permutations

To generate all permutations of an array of numbers, we can use a similar recursive approach. This involves swapping
elements to create new permutations and using a helper function to handle the recursive logic.

## Applications of Permutations

1. **Cryptography**: Permutations are used in various cryptographic algorithms to create complex encryption schemes.
2. **Combinatorial Optimization**: Permutations are crucial in solving optimization problems where the order of elements
   matters.
3. **Sorting Algorithms**: Many sorting algorithms, like bubble sort and quicksort, rely on permutations to arrange
   elements in a specific order.
