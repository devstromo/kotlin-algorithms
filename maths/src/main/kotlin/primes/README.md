# Prime Numbers

Prime numbers are natural numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. They play a
crucial role in number theory and have applications in various fields, including cryptography, computer science, and
mathematics.

## Properties of Prime Numbers

1. **Uniqueness**: Every natural number greater than 1 is either a prime number or can be factored into prime numbers,
   which are unique up to their order (Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic).
2. **Distribution**: The distribution of prime numbers among the natural numbers is irregular. However, the Prime Number
   Theorem provides an approximation of the number of primes less than a given number.
3. **Infinity**: There are infinitely many prime numbers, as proven by Euclid around 300 BC.

## Applications of Prime Numbers

1. **Cryptography**: Prime numbers are fundamental in cryptographic algorithms like RSA, where large prime numbers are
   used to generate public and private keys.
2. **Hashing**: Primes are used in hashing functions to minimize collisions.
3. **Random Number Generation**: Primes are used to improve the randomness and unpredictability of number generation
   algorithms.
